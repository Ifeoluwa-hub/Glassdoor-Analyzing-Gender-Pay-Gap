# Glassdoor-Analyzing-Gender-Pay-Gap

The gender pay gap is a measure of income disparity between men and women. It is commonly calculated by dividing women's wages by men's wages, and this ratio is often expressed as a percent, or in dollar terms.
Women are generally considered to be paid less than men, and the gender pay gap exists for every age group and tends to increase throughout a woman's work life.
To get better clarity on the gender pay gap, the dataset was gotten from glassdoor for this analysis.
